## Introduction

Welcome to FarpointOI, Farpoint's leap into operational intelligence powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence. FarpointOI is designed to automate all operational aspects of the company, harnessing the power of AI to streamline processes, enhance decision-making, and revolutionize the way we work. By integrating advanced AI technologies such as Neural Networks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs), FarpointOI stands at the forefront of operational intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in consulting automation.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Our user interface is developed using **ReactJS**, offering a dynamic and responsive experience that's both powerful and user-friendly.
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by **Python**, known for its versatility and the extensive support for AI and machine learning libraries, making it the perfect choice for our operational intelligence platform.
- **Database**: We utilize **PostgreSQL**, a highly scalable and secure database system, to manage our data efficiently.
- **AI Technologies**: For our AI functionalities, we leverage **Deepgram** for state-of-the-art audio to text conversion and **OpenAI** for its unparalleled capabilities in natural language processing and understanding.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: The entire platform is hosted on **AWS**, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security.

## Code Structure

The FarpointOI project is organized into specific directories, each serving a distinct role within the architecture:

- **`/client`**: Contains all frontend code, built with ReactJS. This directory houses the user interface components, state management, and service integration logic necessary for the frontend application.
- **`/server`**: The home for our backend application code. Written in Python, this directory includes the API endpoints, business logic, and server-side operations required to support the frontend and interact with the database and external AI services.
- **`/transcription`**: Contains scripts and utilities for audio to text conversion using Deepgram. This directory is crucial for processing audio inputs and converting them into text for further analysis or operational actions.
- **`/documentation`**: A dedicated space for project documentation, including setup guides, API references, and usage instructions. This directory ensures that knowledge about FarpointOI is accessible and organized.
