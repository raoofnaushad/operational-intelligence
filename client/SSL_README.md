Since you have already installed Certbot on your server and have a Dockerized React application with Nginx, you'll need to configure Nginx to use the SSL certificates generated by Certbot. This will enable HTTPS for your application. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Generate SSL Certificates with Certbot
Run Certbot:
Use Certbot to generate SSL certificates. If you haven't done this already, you can do so by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d oi.farpointhq.com
This command will obtain a certificate for oi.farpointhq.com.
Follow the prompts to complete the process.
Locate the Certificates:
Certbot typically stores certificates in /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name/. The important files are:

fullchain.pem (The certificate)
privkey.pem (The private key)
Step 2: Update Nginx Configuration for HTTPS
Modify nginx.conf:
Update your Nginx configuration to include settings for HTTPS. You'll need to mount the SSL certificate and key locations as volumes in your Docker container.

Here's an updated version of nginx.conf:

nginx
Copy code
server {
listen 80;
server_name oi.farpointhq.com;
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
listen 443 ssl;
server_name oi.farpointhq.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/oi.farpointhq.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/oi.farpointhq.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

}
Step 3: Update Dockerfile
Modify Your Dockerfile:
Since your SSL certificates are outside the Docker build context, they cannot be directly copied in the Dockerfile.
Remove or comment out any lines copying SSL certificates in the Dockerfile.
Step 4: Update docker-compose.yml
Add Volume Mounts for SSL Certificates:
Modify your docker-compose.yml to mount the SSL certificate directories:
yaml
Copy code
services:
client:
build:
context: ./client
dockerfile: Dockerfile
ports: - "80:80" - "443:443"
volumes: - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt # ... rest of your configuration ...
Step 5: Rebuild and Restart Your Docker Containers
Rebuild Your Docker Containers:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
Restart Your Docker Containers:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Step 6: Test HTTPS Configuration
Verify HTTPS:
Access your application using https://oi.farpointhq.com and ensure the SSL certificate is working correctly.
