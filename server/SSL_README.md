Option 1: Use a Reverse Proxy like Nginx
Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of your Flask application to handle HTTPS:

Obtain a Domain Name:

It's highly recommended to use a domain name for SSL/TLS. You can get a free subdomain from services like noip.com if you don't want to purchase a domain.
Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy:

Use a Dockerized Nginx to proxy requests to your Flask container.
Configure Nginx with SSL using Certbot.
Update docker-compose.yml:

Add Nginx as a service in your docker-compose.yml.
Map the SSL certificate directories as volumes to the Nginx container.
Configure Flask to Run Behind a Proxy:

Make sure Flask knows it's behind a proxy to correctly handle request URLs.
Option 2: Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Backend (Not Recommended for Production)
If you can't use a domain name, you can create a self-signed SSL certificate for development/testing purposes:

Create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate:

Run: openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
This creates key.pem and cert.pem in your current directory.
Modify Your Flask Dockerfile:

Copy the SSL certificate and key into the Docker image.
Modify the CMD to start Flask with SSL:
Dockerfile
Copy code

# ... (rest of the Dockerfile)

COPY ./cert.pem /usr/src/app/cert.pem
COPY ./key.pem /usr/src/app/key.pem

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8080", "--cert=cert.pem", "--key=key.pem"]
Update Your React Application:

Change API calls to use https and the correct IP address or Docker service name.

nginx.conf

server {
listen 80;
server_name yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain name
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
listen 443 ssl;
server_name yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain name

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://server:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

}

docker-compose.yml:

version: "3.8"

services:

# ... (other services like client, server, etc.)

nginx:
image: nginx:alpine
ports: - "80:80" - "443:443"
volumes: - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
depends_on: - server

# ... (rest of your services)
