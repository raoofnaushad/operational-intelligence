And the rest of time sucks. Yeah. Blood of.\nIf you go back to on the trouble if we root\npause this trouble? Is it because you have too many skus? Is it\nNo. Okay. We are... We are low volume, high complexity.\nIt's not like beer or coke. Yeah.\nState Nadine. Yeah.\nYou You're your unique?\nYep. Right. Can you go deeper on the high complexity?\nI've heard from... It's just like your sales\nprocess is really complex. We've heard. Some other things are really complex. What is the high complexity today?\nSo the way I describe it is we're low volume, high mix.\nOn our on our products. So let's say we offer 400 Skus, which\nfor an aquatic manufacturer.\nActually, we offer a lot more skus than that, but the ones that we build in helps such just say it's both\n400 I would say about 60 and those are gonna\nwe talk more than half of my revenue. We\nSo\ncomplex in that we offer very simple systems to\nassist from that being amount a thousand parts.\nSo that's that's where the complexity they come from.\nBut that's a mobile way side of it.\nOkay.\nChristine also mentioned the same thing about the market rejection business an area, You know.\nOh, I didn't wanna jump too much into the solution, but\nthat the\nability to market resource screen\nand the current, like, being able to proactively look at what other.\nLandscape is out there is, like,\nbearing gun.\nAnd I think for me.\nI wouldn't I was step but now on Christine side, but\nI think we we call something probably kept referring to Sql to Sql.\nJust mark marketing qualified leads to sales qualified leads. Right?\nCurrently, that's 25 percent. So if you take it as a independent times,\nIt's it's it's wasted.\nas the Vp of finance. Looking at it. I'm like, okay. Your in to is 25 cents. So 75 percent of your time spent is on what. Right?\nSuccess rates would be 70 80 percent at least. Right. So\nJust the mere fact of looking at the start of our process of marketing qualified these\nsays qualified needs.\nThat is where the problem stocks as we\nremember all of us is down the pipeline. Right? Dennis is down the pipeline like\nforecast is trying to release drive to manufacture but for me,\nThis solution is really starting to look at\nyou get your into Sql.\nK? And if that is proof, they may at least have some form of\nat full cost accuracy and 80 percent of my dennis problems go away.\nSo for me I'm really bad\nWhy is the biggest problem if I look at this?\nIs the front end loading.\nWhether it's front loading of wrong data each\naccurate data, not enough data, not following through on the correct data.\nThat really weigh the biggest problem. Are. That is for me looking at a very\n500. Dennis can say what he thinks, but that's how I look at it.\nAnd then get.\nSo when we also talk with John, and we looked at your systems, I I think\nyou know, maker I wanna be\nsensitive, but you you work with a lot of antiquated systems.\nOh, yes. Yes. Absolutely.\nAnd so if we were really to even go 1 step beyond that,\nNot only are you... It's... You're call interested and drink where not only is\nthe information that you're putting into the form wrong, but the form itself is wrong. Like, the form itself doesn't even\nhave the ability to capture the necessary information and tie it\ndidn't necessary revenue attribution of where the sources\ncame from, where your and ke came from.\nOrganic was paid\neven that basic from showing basis.\nAnd it's not followed through. Right? Whether Ai followed through all that\nAi application, sending an email to a customers. A lot of their\nto Sci has been followed through in 14 days. I think Dennis or something like that.\nYou know how many of those things Are just closed off to 14 days for someone has got a read\nguy gets their name. So they just close it without\nany any follow through with the customer?\nJust lost a 600000 dollar project like that.\nWhat is the red sticker next to their name signify? Why is that?\nI mean, it's just... It shows you have a few... It's gonna quick.\nThat's why I'm rachel.\nI think you're tip speaking speaker. Right? You have\nand you have something 30 days open that a marketing we need say to. Okay. Was that in Rpa?\nI was a trade show. I identified that wants to buy something possibly from each.\nYou have to follow on that within 14 days. And after 30 days I haven't\nmoment, I just closed it put pretend my did, but I didn't.\nS and we do have some better\nApis separate track. So, you know, you're\nstarted that you don't wanna be on their on the Naughty list. So they"
